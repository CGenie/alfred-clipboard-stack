# `alfred-clipboard-stack`

A clipboard that behaves like a stack, i.e. copy is a stack push, paste is a
stack pop.

This makes it easier to copy & paste multiple entries (like when making a bank
transfer) by reducing context switching: first copy all the items and then
paste them one after another, in that same order.
